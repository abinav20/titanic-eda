This project explores the Titanic dataset to identify the factors that most influenced passenger survival.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Gender:** Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
* **Class:** First-class passengers were prioritized for rescue.
* **Deck:** Passengers with assigned cabins (likely higher decks) had better survival outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data cleaning and manipulation.
* **Seaborn/Matplotlib:** For data visualization (Bar charts, Histograms).
* **NumPy:** For logarithmic transformations on skewed data (Fare).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy`
3. Open `titanic-eda.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook.
